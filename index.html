Make your own step-by-step guide
================================

This template allows you to build a more advanced step-by-step guide.
The example theme here is for you to change as much as you like to
create appearance and content which are truly your own.

READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of
this for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but
instead are just text comments about the code. For this project, the
comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing
the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding
of what you are being asked to do.

GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like
this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information
contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side
of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

IN THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT:

- HTML: Nested lists
- HTML: Unordered list
- HTML: Captions
- CSS: Borders
- CSS: Embedding images and videos

              <h3>Make the title or subject line interesting and informative.</h3>
              <p>Mention the content of the newsletter and use keywords. You're more likely to skip over a newsletter if the subject line or title just repeats the name of your business or the date of the newsletter. Instead, give a little taste of what the newsletter covers by dropping interesting keywords.

              <h3>Outline the main points you want to make.</h3>
              <p>Write about key points so you don't overwhelm your readers. If someone opens your newsletter and sees a lot of topics like a list of all your products, they may quickly skim or not even start to read. To grab your reader, pick just a couple of points that you want to cover. Include things that have high-quality value for your readers like exclusive offers, opportunities they should be aware of, or changes to your services or business.</p>

              <h3>Give authoritative information.</h3>
              <p>Cultivate trust with your readers by sharing accurate, reliable information.This is important whether you're selling products, interacting with your community, or you run your own blog. Always support information that you're sharing by backing it up with credible sources or interviews. For example, if you have a real estate newsletter, you might link to current mortgage rates or housing sales.</p>

              <h3>Limit the promotional content in your newsletter.</h3>
              <p>Aim for 90% new or informative content with less than 10% promotional content. Most readers won't appreciate a newsletter that's just pushing them to buy products. Instead, they're looking for something of value. This might mean information about a topic they're interested in, an update about something that's important to the group, or about an upcoming event, for instance. If you do include promotional info, keep it brief.</p>

              <h3>Close out your newsletter with a call to action.</h3>
              <p>Give links to your own website or other sources that you referenced. This encourages engagement with your readers and it's a good way to offer even more information without cluttering up your newsletter.</p>

            <div class="content">
              <h3>Keep your writing conversational.</h3>
              <p>Write your newsletter as though you're communicating with a friend.Instead of using stilted, formal word choices, use contractions and try to keep your writing loose. For instance, instead of saying, "The Cultural Center values your input on a recent survey. It is very good of you to give your time," you could write, "The Cultural center really values the time you spent giving your input on our recent survey. Thanks again.

              <h3>Make it personal.</h3>
              <p>Address the sender by name so they feel a connection. Check if your email marketing platform lets you add recipient's names to the introduction. As you write the rest of the newsletter, imagine you're writing specifically to one person instead of an audience. This makes it easier for you to write in a thoughtful, individual way that connects more with your readers, even if you've got a lot of them!</p>

              <h3>Choose a streamlined format that you like.</h3>
              <p>Keep things simple and do a layout that you enjoy. You might write a paragraph for each topic you want to cover, you could use a questions-and-answers format, or you might share a customer success story, for instance. Stick with 1 style so you don't overdo it. Once you find a format you like, it will probably be easier to sit down and make your newsletter on a regular basis.

              <h3>Make the format easy for your audience to read.</h3>
              <p>Stick with 1 to 2 fonts that are large enough for viewers. Too many fonts, colors, and sizes can be distracting in a newsletter. To streamline your newsletter, use 1 font for the whole newsletter or use 1 for the headings and a separate font for the text.</p>

              <h3>Include relevant images so your newsletter pops.</h3>
              <p>Break up the text with useful images that grab your readers. Avoid using generic stock photos or clip art. Instead, add photos that match the material of your newsletter. Aim for inserting 1 relevant photo for each of your main points. This can also help to visually separate your points.</p>

              <h3>Proofread before you send it out.</h3>
              <p>Grammatical errors and typos can turn off some of your readers. While you probably have a spellchecking or grammar tool, don't rely completely on it. Spend some time reading through your newsletter before you finalize it. Pay attention to how the tone sounds and whether or not you included all the information you wanted to.</p>
